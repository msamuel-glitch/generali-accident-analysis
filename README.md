We assessed the relationship between the mean risk and the urbanisation of the area in which the claim has occurred (on a scale from 1 to 8). We ran a Pearson’s correlation coefficient which resulted in a p-value of 0.750943

Although geo-segmented pricing exists, refining premiums to reflect these differences could reduce high-risk zone losses by an estimated 8-12% while maintaining competitiveness in low-risk areas, which tend to represent less wealthy consumers. This data can serve as a very powerful tool in the fine-tuning of current geo-segmentation models Generali uses in its decision-making process regarding pricing methods.]

Vehicle group:
Higher vehicle groups (r=0.54) are clearly associated with greater average risk. Incorporating vehicle group coefficients in premium calculations—especially for high-value or performance models—could yield a 5–7% improvement in technical profitability, by better reflecting exposure to repair and liability costs.

Vehicle power:
Powerful engines drive both higher severity and frequency of claims(r=0.50). Generali could tighten power-based loadings in the pricing model or propose safe-driving incentives for high-power cars. This may cut high-risk claim frequency

## THOSE TWO VALUES ARE MERGED TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR IN ALL ASPECTS

Driving experience: Samuel

Newer drivers remain riskier. By rewarding longer licence maturity through experience-based discounts, Generali could increase retention of low-risk, experienced drivers while maintaining higher pricing for newly licensed profiles. This segmentation could improve combined ratio by 3–5%.
Since we have seen the negative correlation between the driver’s experience and risk we could give generate a strategy of
